                          All right, You just setup your blog! Now what? Well there are a couple of things you can do
                          for example, you can create a new post or start to change this amazing template!

                          Is Bluag for you? I dont know I just built this to practice playing with the Lua programming
                          language. Also I wanted to start a blog but didn't want to use the massive thing that is them 
                          crazy CMS thingies. I hope that with Bluag, as a developer you can just easisly manipulate the
                          content of your post and just over all have more fun instead of dealing with broken or confusing
                          plugins.
